Hello Team Otis,

Here is the first version (V1) of your brand new website. 

To view make sure you have downloaded the entire file WEB_OTIS_V1 and then simply double click (tap tap) on the index.html file. 

Donâ€™t go poking around any of the other files... you might break something or find the illicit ~content~ I have littered throughout the code. 

There was one issue with the image for fig. 2 in the bio section so I had to use an old image, but we can fix that later.

Please enjoy and let me know if there is anything that needs fixing.  

Bon Appetit!
